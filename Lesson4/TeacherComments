There were actually no need to do it with one query. That's great that you can find multiple ways to do similar tasks. Good job! :)

f)
"for each SalesOrderID" was added to notify that you need to use PARTITION BY.

Why do you need REPLACE function? As I see, you want to replace space by empty value, but how can you find space, if in ISNULL you have empty value?
