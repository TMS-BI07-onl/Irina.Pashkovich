Well done!

1. 
b) -0.5 
There is no requirements in the task to rearrange query results. So order by is not needed. 
c) 
It's not a mistake, but don't overthink the task. We haven't talked about joins yet. :)

4. 
a) -1  
Correct answer: ... WHERE LastName LIKE 'M%' OR NOT EmailPromotion LIKE '%1%'. 
Second condition is not "equal", it's "including". For example, if after next data update there is a EmailPromotion 3451654, it should be added to the final result set.
Once again, order by is not required.
c) -0.5 
Which query from two should I check?
First one doesn't need name column in the select list. We' re looking for one weight and one size, not for each product.
Second one is (once again) overthinking.

Mark: 8.
